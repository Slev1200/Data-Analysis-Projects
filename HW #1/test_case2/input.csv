But I experienced a HIKE today on an ice boat called Zephyr III with Bob Mereness at the helm. In this case a hike is when the boat edges up on two of the three runners. Ice boats can get up to 100 mph although today I think we were only going about 50, which was plenty fast for this newby!\n\nSo I started by walking out on transparent ice, so see-through that I felt like I was walking on water. You could see fish swimming underneath. I was questioning my own sanity for just a second but then remembered I am committed to getting the shot no matter what so I charged on about a 1/4 mile into Lake Geneva with my Canon 5D Mark II with 1080p HD video built in. It turned out that a monopod and my 24-105 lens was the perfect combination for the video project.\n\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nMusic by Secrets in Stereo.

With 80,000 pounds of cargo, it can make the same run in just 20 seconds. It can charge up to 400 miles in just 30 minutes when using a Megacharger, which is a new high-speed charger.\n\nThe interior of the vehicle is minimalistic and designed around the comfort of the driver. The driver position is placed in the center of the vehicle, instead of on the left side. This helps provide greater visibility to the driver, Musk said. The cabin is also spacious enough for the driver to stand.\n\nTesla will begin production of the vehicle in 2019. The company is currently taking reservations for the semi, but a deposit will set buyers back $5,000.\n\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/"

The BEST Street Food in India is AMAZING, and we're going on a full street food tour of Kolkata to try India's BEST Street Food, probably the BEST Street Food around the world!\n\nIf you travel to Kolkata, India, make sure you try the delicious Indian street food and Bengali street food delicacies. The Indian recipes on the street are so unique and delicious! You really could spend a lifetime eating the delicious Indian street food and curry here.\n\nWe started our Indian street food tour in Kolkata by warming up with a nice Indian breakfast, right on the street corner. You can order samosas, potato curry chickpea sabzi, jalebi, and hot tea as well. All of these go so well in the morning and wake you up and get you ready to start your day.\n\nAfter that amazing Indian street breakfast, we went to try perhaps the most beautiful and photogenic Indian street food lunch stall I've ever seen. It really was like walking up to CURRY HEAVEN! There were so many delicious curries to choose from, and there was a huge pot of CHICKEN biryani right on the street. The Chicken looked so tender and you could see the steam and all the juices were infused into the basmati rice. You could also smell the cardamom in the biryani!\n\nAfter that life changing Indian curry meal, we made our way to try a bunch more delicious street foods. There were so many to choose from!\n\nHere are the addresses for the street food locations we found while filming this Indian street food travel vlog in late 2017.\n\n1) Indian street food Vegetarian breakfast: 168 A, Sarat Bose Rd, Lake Market, Kalighat, Kolkata, West Bengal 700029\n2) Incredible Indian curry HEAVEN lunch: GP Block, Sector V, Salt Lake City, Kolkata\n3) Amazing Kolkata Fish Fry (Kind of like British Fish and Chips) : Mitra Cafe, 23/37, Gariahat Road, Golpark, Kolkata\n4) Amazing Pani Puri AKA Pulchka's at Pravesh Pani Puri\n5) Delicious Rasgullah's and Indian desserts at Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, 2, Paddapukur Road, Jadubabur Bazar, Bhowanipore, Jadubabur Bazar, Bhowanipore, Kolkata\n6) Amazing Haleem Beef Stew on the streetside, near Arsalan Biryani Shop, Park circus.\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER\n\n My name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious . I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way! Over the next few years, I'm going to travel around the world and document as much food as I can for you! I love delicious food!

DON'T GIVE UP HOPE - more research will be done, there are other options you haven't tried yet, you will feel present again one day - but just in case that day doesn't come/it takes a while, you might as well enjoy life as best as you can whilst feeling spaced out!\n\nLast year I could barely talk to people I was that spaced out! I didn't want to leave my flat for fear my existence would be snuffed out it felt so fragile. But now I wake up and although I still am living in this weird dreamlike world, I can function and make an impression on the world, despite barely feeling like I'm in it.\n\nIt will be okay!

Jerusalem is home to important holy sites for all the Abrahamic religions, and so it has become a critical bargaining chip in the ongoing discussion between Israelis and Palestinians. \n\nPresident Trump's administration announced in 2017 that it would officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and that it planned to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. This would make the U.S. the only country in the world with an embassy to Israel in Jerusalem - there are currently various consulates, but no embassies. The announcement spurred condemnation from various countries, including U.S. allies, and has quickly become a political flashpoint of the Middle East.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet her status prevents her from the traditions of noble social standing.  While her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) chases suitors for marriage, Belle is left on the sidelines wondering if she will ever find love.  After meeting an idealistic young vicar's son bent on changing society, he and Belle help shape Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England."

Edited and Directed By Leslie Asako Gladsjo. \n\nThe Museum was so pleased with the SRL show that they actually  attempted to sue us a few months later. Recently, when speaking to a museum employee conducting research into the 1992 Groundbreaking for inclusion into the new ribbon cutting at the rebuilt SFMOMA, SRL was informed that the Museum had systematically removed all reference to SRL even being at the 1992 Groundbreaking!  The only remaining historical document is this SRL produced video.\n\nIt takes serious skills to stage a show at a major museum that would provoke them into completely rewriting the show out of their own history. SRL says: Mission Accomplished!! Also, its still not too late to invite us for the Ribbon Cutting....."

fmqcXfcrAis,18.13.01,Controlling swarms of flies and gnats by singing tones to them,Fontgod,15,2018-01-12T12:53:50.000Z,sand fly swarm|can insects hear|controlling fly swarm with voice|singing to insects|lord of the flies|gnat swarm reacting to singing|gnat swarm reacting to voice|gnat swams reacting to sound,9666,94,7,9,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fmqcXfcrAis/default.jpg,False,False,False,A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video.\n\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\n\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\n\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.

The chip is connected to the Raspberry pi via SPI.\n- The Raspberry Pi reads all the potentiometer values and sends position commands to the Arduino.\n- Here's the complete code for the Raspberry Pi:\nhttps://github.com/T-Kuhn/StepperRobotArm

This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \n\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \n\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10.

We went for a full on Mexican street food tour in Puebla, Mexico, and discovered the most incredible FAST cutting sandwich lady, with the fastest knife cutting skills, kind of like the Super Human Sandwich Fruit Ninja of Mexico, along with amazing tacos with spicy salsa and delicious mole poblano! ALL of the Best Mexican Street Food!\n\nIn this street food tour vlog, we venture outside of Mexico city to Puebla, to eat the best street food in Mexico and taste the world famous Mole sauce over top of juicy chicken. It was spicy, full of chili, and so delicious. \n\nThe Best Street Food we found, was definitely the cemita sandwich from Puebla, which was made by the most amazing woman, the Sandwich Ninja of Mexico! The cemita sandwich was cut so fast with amazing skills, EXTREMELY fast! Her knife skills were incredible, chopping and cutting so fast with the avocado fruit and the chicken as well. The way her hands worked was amazing to watch, and this was just one of the street foods we had in Puebla, Mexico! The Chicken sandwich was so plump and delicious\n\nWe started our street food tour in Mexico in Mexico city, eating a ton of delicious street food in Part 1 and 2 here:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dHnqNOvDi44\nhttps://youtu.be/W0Anp0wmXek\n\nAfter this, we spent a day on a street food adventure to go to Puebla, all in search of the famous Mole poblano, but we found so much more.  The first thing we did was visit a local market and try out a bunch of food in the market, like juicy lamb tacos, covered in spicy salsa and then spicy stomach tortilla tacos as well. This is the beauty of Mexican street food, the amazing variation and extreme deliciousness of the cuisine that makes your mouth come alive. \n\nAfter those amazing Mexican tacos, we kept exploring the farmers market even more and found delicious salads and pickled chilies that blew my mouth off, they were so hot and spicy!\n\nAfter this, we found the world famous Mexican Mole Poblano, famous from Puebla that was incredibly flavourful, full of chocolate, chilies, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, and more!\n\nAfter exploring the street food market a little more, we drove to Puebla and found the most amazing sandwich ninja cutting up with super human skill each ingredient and fruit like avocado to put into the sandwich and slice with incredible speed and precision! She was so fast! The sandwich was prepared very fast and it was so delicious as well! She had GOD LEVEL skill, her knife skills were so fast and so fun to watch. \n\nAfter eating the sandwich with the locals and enjoying the flavour, we went on to have one final meal in Puebla, Mexico, except this one wasn't a street food. We wanted to try the stuffed chili pepper, but it wasn't in season! So we had a pumpkin seed sauce over top of pork and it was still fairly delicious.\n\nHere are the addresses for the locations in this street food vlog:\n\n1) Lamb Tacos with delicious spicy salsa - Inside the Cholula Farmers Market near the town square\n2) Amazing Mexican salad bar featuring spicy pickled chipotle chilies and cow feet salad along with Nopales prickly pear cactus salad - Also inside the Cholula farmers market\n3) Mole Poblano rich and dark chocolate sauce with chili, nuts, fruit, and cinnamon - Also found inside the cholula local farmers street food market\n4) Super human fast cutting skills sandwich lady of Mexico - Found in Puebla downtown - Super Cemitas El As De Oros\n5) Pretty delicious but not amazing Pueblan dinner found downtown Puebla\n\nABOUT THE FOOD RANGER \n\nMy name is Trevor James and I'm a hungry traveler and Mandarin learner that's currently living in Chengdu, Szechuan, China, eating up as much delicious street food as I can . I enjoy tasting and documenting as many dishes as I can and I'm going to make videos for YOU along the way! Over the next few years, I'm going to travel around the world and document as much food as I can for you! I love delicious food!

He's a Bengal mix, born sometime in mid-2007; I celebrate his b-day on May 20th.  He rescued me in July of 2007.  Sparta love stalking, wrestling, crunchy toys, playing fetch and being held like a baby.\n\nLoki - the long white kitty that looks like a cow but I believe he may be part monkey. Loki is about the same age as Sparta, so we celebrate their birthdays together. He found me at a rescue center in July of 2008. He loves toys, making noise, hanging upside down, poking things and more than anything, he loves the love!"

If I consumed even the smallest amounts of lactose I'd be violently ill within the hour. So as I was choosing my university I vowed that one day I'd fix it.\n\nRecently my friend Gabriel Licina, renowned biohacker and genetic engineer, gave me access to the tools and materials I needed to make a therapy that could potentially fix the issue. The therapy uses a virus called an AAV to deliver DNA that codes for the enzyme that breaks down lactose. When packaged into a pill and ingested, the virus should induce my intestine to produce lactase, effectively restoring lactose tolerance.\n\nThis project was based on research done by other scientists and I've included links to all the papers below. I've also included links to all of the places I got the viral DNA kits from. The other reagents and media were all purchased from the thermofisher catalogue. \n\nI'm also working on a writeup of this procedure and will hopefully publish a paper on the results once I've collected more data. I know that so far my sample size is still only N=1 but my life has changed from this project and I wanted to share my progress. I'm not going to make any claims about the project other than my life seems to have improved. \n\nThis is for educational purposes only. Do not attempt anything you see, unless you are an experienced biologist. \n\n__________________________________________________________________\nResources:\n\nOriginal paper: http://sci-hub.la/10.1038/2625\npAAVLacz Plasmid: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/paav-lacz-control-plasmid\nAAV kit: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/aav-2-cmv-expression-system\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nInterested in some sweet science themed designs for your wardrobe or wall?

D grows up under the wing of a Kingston Don and music producer named King Fox (Sheldon Shepherd). Fox dispatches him to London, where he reconnects with his childhood sweetheart, Yvonne (Shantol Jackson), and his daughter who he's not seen since she was a baby. He also hooks up with a soundclash crew, called High Noon. But before he can be convinced to abandon his life of crime and follow the righteous path, he encounters the man who shot his brother 10 years earlier, and embarks on a bloody, explosive quest for retribution - a quest which brings him into conflict with vicious London gangster Rico (Stephen Graham).\n\nFollow the Yardie film channels for more updates:\n\nfacebook.com/YardieFilm \ntwitter.com/YardieFilm\ninstagram.com/YardieFilm"

This was the first Oscar win for Peele, he said, This means so much to me. I stopped writing this movie 20 times because I thought... no one would ever make this movie. This is a historic win as Peele is the first black writer to win an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nIn Get Out, photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is nervous about meeting his girlfriend Rose's parents for the first time, especially when he learns that she has not told them that he is black. Their awkward behavior, along with the oddness exhibited by their two African-American servants, puts Chris on alert but even so, he is unprepared for the family's true motivations.\n\nWatch the trailer on Oscar.com here: http://oscar.go.com/video/best-actor-nominees/get-out-trailer\n\nFor more Oscars highlights and can't miss moments visit Oscar.com:\nAcceptance Speeches & Interviews: http://oscar.go.com/video \nRed Carpet Galleries: http://oscar.go.com/red-carpet\nWinners: http://oscar.go.com/winners"

Other than that brief period on Game of Thrones when she dyed her hair black, the lady of Winterfell never strays from her signature red color. But the actress that plays her, Sophie Turner, is far more experimental. She's dyed her hair from blonde to red and back again more times than she'd like to recall. Turner's also been the face of haircare brand Wella Professionals since June 2017, so it's safe to say she knows a thing or two about good hair.\nOf all the hairstyles on Game of Thrones, braids reign supreme. To test her knowledge, we asked Turner to look at a series of hairstyles and guess whether they were from Westeros or the runway. \n\nSubscribe to Harper's Bazaar: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoBAZAAR\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar\nhttps://twitter.com/harpersbazaarus\nhttps://www.instagram.com/harpersbazaarus/\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/harpersbazaar/?auto_follow=1"
