But ever so often I need a tool that DeWalt doesn't make, like a Hot Glue Gun, a Water Spray, a Random Orbit Sander, or a Tire Inflator. Instead of spending the money to build up (and then have to tote around) a second set of batteries, this adapter lets me keep using the same batteries.\\\\n\\\\nNote: This adapter DOES NOT work with DeWalt Flexvolt 60v Batteries.\\\\n\\\\nI GREATLY suggest using a genuine DeWalt 20v to 18v Adapter and if you purchase one from the links below you help support my channel:\\\\n\\\\nDewalt 20v to 18v adapter: http://amzn.to/2BBTtpR\\\\n\\\\nRyobi Battery: http://amzn.to/2CsOjsP\\\\n\\\\nEpoxy for plastics: http://amzn.to/2CuuBx0\\\\n\\\\nSoldering Station: http://amzn.to/2Ct8bMF\\\\n\\\\nSolder: http://amzn.to/2ECrmJR\\\\n\\\\nHeat Shrink Kit: http://amzn.to/2FbjL1I\\\\n\\\\nPlease Like this video if you feel it earned it and share it with your friends.

A person (not shown) drives the robot up to the door, points the hand at the door handle, then gives the 'GO' command, both at the beginning of the video and again at 42 seconds.  The robot proceeds autonomously from these points on.  A camera in the hand finds the door handle, cameras on the body determine if the door is open or closed and help navigate through the doorway.  Controllers provide locomotion, balance and adjust behavior when progress gets off track.  The ability to tolerate and respond to disturbances like these improves successful operation of the robot.

Ever since I made the potato stacks I always wanted to cut them a bit thinner and more French fry-like and apparently its just as incredible and even a bit crispier. I have to thank my sponsor Grana Padano for me with their beautiful  20+ month aged cheese! It  was a perfect compliment to the stacks and the herbs just put it over the top! Cheese is always a good addition when it comes to potatoes...or almost anything else.\\\\n\\\\nWhat is Grana Padano: http://bit.ly/2Bn3m7G\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/1mk8ehM\\\\nWEBSITE: http://www.byrontalbott.com \\\\nBUSINESS INQUIRY: byronlovesfood@gmail.com\\\\nMAILING ADDRESS: 18653 Ventura Blvd., #655, Tarzana, CA 91356\\\\n\\\\nTWITTER: http://www.Twitter.com/ByronTalbott\\\\nINSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/ByronTalbott\\\\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/ByronTalbottFood\\\\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/botalbott/\\\\n\\\\nMOST USED TOOLS:\\\\nBoos Walnut Cutting Board: http://amzn.to/1LKPfLj\\\\nBoos Maple Cutting Board: http://amzn.to/1Iw6tKH\\\\nTweezer Tongs: http://bit.ly/1PiuAfV\\\\nKitchenAid Mixer: http://amzn.to/1KfoWfZ \\\\nKitchenAid Ice Cream Attachment: http://amzn.to/1djb3i8 \\\\nVitamix:  http://bit.ly/1EtVugM \\\\nInduction Stove Top: http://amzn.to/1kZnP7f \\\\nOXO Good Grips Container: http://amzn.to/1pJbVjj \\\\nShun Kaji Chef Knife: http://amzn.to/1UdrH4z   \\\\nShun Kaji Cleaver: http://amzn.to/1GRrgnd \\\\nShun Kaji Knife Set: http://amzn.to/1LXz9eu \\\\nAll-Clad Sauce Pan: http://amzn.to/1Ly50oU\\\\nAll-Clad Fry Pan: http://amzn.to/1emXaQJ\\\\nAll-Clad Pot: http://amzn.to/1LKUB9p\\\\nAll-Clad Grill: http://amzn.to/1KvzE25\\\\nAll-Clad Strainer: http://bit.ly/1Ibm4we\\\\nAll-Clad Mixing Bowls: http://amzn.to/1Hz2jAO\\\\nGlass Bowls: http://amzn.to/1GmvN2U\\\\nCheese Board: http://bit.ly/1EUdoH2\\\\nMarble Slab: http://amzn.to/1NfP5Jg \\\\nTemperature Gun: http://amzn.to/1CNO59N\\\\nPastry Bag: http://amzn.to/1KqMRsY\\\\nMeasuring Spoons: http://amzn.to/1T8BE1F\\\\nSqueeze Bottles: http://amzn.to/1KxaRZX\\\\nSheet Tray: http://amzn.to/1T1l3N5 \\\\nSilpat: http://amzn.to/1GMnn2O \\\\nWire Whisk: http://amzn.to/1GGEUPk\\\\nOffset Spatula: http://amzn.to/1GMnWd8\\\\nPasta Maker:  http://bit.ly/1xIjCGD \\\\nRing Molds: http://amzn.to/1IS9Tmx\\\\nHand Grater: http://amzn.to/1gd6Jmx\\\\nBox Grater: http://amzn.to/1gd7qMT\\\\nPepper Grinder: http://amzn.to/1KwXbOx\\\\nMini Carafe: http://amzn.to/1s2x7AJ \\\\nMini Glass Pitcher: http://amzn.to/1sbWpf8 \\\\nPorcelain Dish: http://amzn.to/1LXS8Wi \\\\nTart Ramekin: http://amzn.to/1GGEsAI\\\\nGlass Ramekins: http://amzn.to/1HGG38t\\\\nIce Cream Scoop: http://amzn.to/1GAKZ9H \\\\nMetal Canoli Mold: http://amzn.to/1duJYsh \\\\nWaffle Iron: http://amzn.to/1Ce3R31\\\\nGnocchi Board: http://amzn.to/1gd7qMT\\\\n\\\\nINGREDIENTS:\\\\n3-4 russet potatoes \\\\n1 tbsp chopped rosemary \\\\n1 tbsp chopped thyme \\\\n3-4 tbsp Grana Padano (20+ month aged preferably)\\\\n1 qt safflower oil\\\\nSalt & Pepper to taste\"\n",

      "        \"description\": \"STOP! First, subscribe to Alec Steele's amazing YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/alectheblacksmith\\\\nCheck out the 3 videos of the plane blade being forged - https://youtu.be/017RX4U5BTI\\\\n\\\\nTHANK YOU TO ROCKLER FOR MAKING THIS VIDEO POSSIBLE!\\\\n                  http://www.rockler.com\\\\n\\\\nLife lesson.  Never say no to Alec Steele.  He asked if I'd be interested in coming up with a collaborative project and my answer was OMG yes!  We decided to make a high angle smoother plane.   Damascus steel blade, hand forged by Alec, and the plane body, sculpted by me.  Originally there were going to be two blades and two planes, but blacksmithing is hard!  One of the blades didn't pass QC so Alec moved ahead with just the single blade. \\\\n\\\\nThis is a high angle smoother plane.  It is made to take thin layers of wood off of lumber to leave a super smooth surface that requires minimal sanding.  This is especially useful for highly figured wood.\\\\n\\\\nSpeaking of highly figured wood, the body of the plane is made out of some amazing curly walnut.  For a little extra flair, I added a paduak racing strip to the right side. The Rockler Bandy Clamps made the glue ups a breeze.\\\\n\\\\nHand planes are devilishly easy to make, but incredibly difficult to make right.  I did a ton of research before getting started to calculate angles, size, shape, and even materials to give myself the best chance of success.  If I someday decide this design doesn't work for me anymore, I can simply build another one.  The blade isn't going anywhere!  All the angled cuts were made on the Rockler Table Saw Sled so I could do them safely and accurately.  This is possibly my number one favourite tool from Rockler.  The sled is perfect.\\\\n\\\\nI roughed out the shape on the bandsaw before sculpting the shape with files, chisels and sandpaper.  The Rockler T-Track Table made this so easy since I was able to flip, rotate and adjust the placement of the plane so I could easily trim wherever I needed to.  Once I was happy with the shape and it fit my hands nicely I sanded for hours.  Every surface was sanded to 400.\\\\n\\\\nTo compliment the paduak stripe I chose a 1/4 copper rod instead of the more traditional brass rod.  I drilled the hole, polished the rod and hammered it home.  Friction is enough to keep it from going anywhere.  The wedge was cut from scrap and sanded to fit perfectly against the blade.  The fit of the wedge is extremly important to how well the plane performs.  \\\\n\\\\nAfter ensureing all parts of the plane work together perfectly I applied 2 coats of danish oil.  It gave the plane a beautiful low luster finish while bringing out the figure of the wood perfectly.  After a few weeks I will come back and give it a light waxing.  \\\\n\\\\nI think thats everything... Be sure to check out the 3 videos Alec made showing how the plane blade was forged.  It's incredible to watch and Alec's energy is infectious.  You will just be happy after watching.  Also a big thank you to Rockler for supporting not only me, but so many makers around the world.  \\\\n\\\\n===========================================\\\\n- Instagram - http://instagram.com/dpmakestuff\\\\n- Patreon - https://www.patreon.com/dpmakestuff\\\\n- Plans - http://www.dpmakestuff.com\\\\n\\\\n===========================================\\\\n= Links To Tools Used =\\\\n\\\\nTape Cutter:  http://amzn.to/2wExKdG\\\\nTable Saw Sled: http://shrsl.com/r87s\\\\nBandy Clamps: http://shrsl.com/r87v\\\\nT-Track Table: http://shrsl.com/r88e\\\\nFlexcut Chisels: http://shrsl.com/r88f\\\\nSilicon Mat: http://amzn.to/2FldFL4\\\\nGlue Brush: http://amzn.to/2EgCgBp\\\\nDanish Oil: http://amzn.to/2EdW3kW\\\\nWooden Mallet:  http://amzn.to/2gLRJ4I\\\\nRuler:  http://amzn.to/2bOARY4\\\\nTitebond Glue:  http://amzn.to/1TmiBAs\\\\nChisels:  http://amzn.to/2w5fKpm\\\\nForstner Drill Bits:  http://amzn.to/2bRDTMk\\\\nF Clamps:  http://amzn.to/2gL4lJy\\\\n\\\\n===========================================\\\\n\\\\n= Bookmark these to support the channel =\\\\n- Amazon - http://amzn.to/2ezs5zq\\\\n- Amazon Canada - http://amzn.to/2vVrz1m\\\\n\\\\n===========================================\\\\n\\\\n= Shop Equipment =\\\\nRockler Stuff:  http://amzn.to/2bYUGJf\\\\nSaw Stop:  http://amzn.to/2ctLWdP\\\\nBand Saw:  http://amzn.to/2c72OZN\\\\nLathe:  http://amzn.to/2e9IjMN\\\\nX Carve CNC:  https://www.inventables.com/technologies/x-carve\\\\n\\\\n===========================================\\\\nFeeling like sending me a letter, stickers or crisp 100 dollar bill?

      "        \"description\": \"It's the second SpaceX launch of 2018! SpaceX will launch a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a 4200 KG satellite called GovSat-1/SES-16 to Geostationary Transfer Orbit. This satellite serves the Luxembourg Government and a commercial customer SES. This is the 2nd flight of this particular Falcon 9 1st stage, having first flown last year for the NROL-76 mission, but it will be its last. \\\\n\\\\nDespite having plenty of fuel to land, they will be letting this one touch down softly in the ocean after its primary mission is over. This is because SpaceX has so many of these current block 3 boosters around which are not meant for long term reuse, and they require too much refurbishment to reuse them more than once, AND the drone ship needs to be ready for Falcon Heavy's center core next week. \\\\n\\\\nThis is the third time SES has opted to fly on a previously flown booster, they were the first customers to do so March, 2017 with mission SES-10. This is the 6th reuse of a booster for SpaceX. This is the 29th launch from SpaceX's launch pad, SLC-40, and the 48th over all launch of the Falcon 9. \\\\n\\\\nShow your support and join our discord channel by becoming Patron - http://patreon.com/everydayastronaut\\\\n\\\\nMusic by Everyday Astronaut - http://soundcloud.com/everydayastronaut\\\\n\\\\nEveryday Astronaut hats, prints, shirts and more at - https://everydayastronaut.com/shop/\\\\n\\\\nSpaceX models by Oli Braun http://twitter.com/oli_braun and his store - https://www.buzzspacemodels.com/\"\n",

      "        \"description\": \"A few years ago I discovered an interesting insect behaviour whereby I could seemingly control large swarms of tiny flies/gnats simply by singing a range of tones to them. I first noticed this in the UK in 2004 but have since been able to replicate the experiment several times here in Australia and more recently captured it on video.\\\\n\\\\nInitially I noticed that a swarm of gnats above me seemed to slow their frantic movement when I started to speak and after a little experimentation I discovered that certain higher pitched vocals would cause the flies to noticeably rise upwards as a group and then rapidly drop downwards again upon ceasing the tone.\\\\n\\\\nI've noticed this both with gnats in a forest environment and also with sand fly swarms at the beach. What's also interesting is the flies seem to have excellent hearing over quite some distance as I have seen them reacting to a dog barking perhaps 50m away.\\\\n\\\\nI'd be interested to know if anyone has ever noticed this insect behaviour before or been able to capture it on video. If you happen to be an entomologist I'd also be interested in discussing this with you.\"\n",

Recently, when speaking to a museum employee conducting research into the 1992 Groundbreaking for inclusion into the new ribbon cutting at the rebuilt SFMOMA, SRL was informed that the Museum had systematically removed all reference to SRL even being at the 1992 Groundbreaking!  The only remaining historical document is this SRL produced video.\\\\n\\\\nIt takes serious skills to stage a show at a major museum that would provoke them into completely rewriting the show out of their own history.

Some of Rollins' students became a group of regulars who participated in an after-school and weekend program called the Art of Knowledge Workshop. The students named themselves K.O.S. which stands for Kids of Survival. What we're doing changes people's conception about who can make art, how art is made, who can learn and what's possible, because a lot of these kids had been written off by the school system.

It has an unused output on the print head, that can be controlled from within gcode. That opens up a ton of possibilities, but what I am most interested in is, as always, laser PCB prototyping. Will that work? Spoiler: Yes, it will. Incredibly well.\"\n",

Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet her status prevents her from the traditions of noble social standing.  While her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) chases suitors for marriage, Belle is left on the sidelines wondering if she will ever find love.  After meeting an idealistic young vicar's son bent on changing society, he and Belle help shape Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England.\"\n",

      "        \"description\": \"Leading a more active lifestyle takes time, effort, and determination, but in the end, it's really worth the shot. Here's what will happen to your body when you exercise regularly.\\\\n\\\\nFollowing is a transcript of the video.\\\\n\\\\nIf you're thinking about leading a more active lifestyle, you're not alone. In recent years, an increasing number of Americans have started participating in more sports, fitness, and recreation. Whether you're trying to get fit or build muscle, or you're just tired of the couch, here are some changes you can expect along the way.\\\\n\\\\nWhat happens to your body when you start exercising regularly?\\\\n\\\\nDuring that first workout, you might feel more alert and energized because ramping up your heart rate means a boost in overall blood flow and oxygen to the brain. But prepare yourself for the day after, when you'll almost certainly get a case of DOMS, short for delayed onset muscle soreness. The soreness will persist for about 72 hours, but the good news is you're less likely to get it again as long as you continue to regularly exercise those same muscles.\\\\n\\\\nOver the next few weeks you'll slowly start to ramp up production of mitochondria via a process called mitochondrial biogenesis. Mitochondria are the parts of your cells that convert carbs, fat, and protein into fuel that your muscles use to do their job, like flex and contract. After six to eight weeks, studies have shown that people can increase their mitochondria by up to 50%. With more mitochondria in your cells, you'll start to feel more fit, and your endurance will increase. So running three miles will no longer feel as difficult as it did during that first week.\\\\n\\\\nOnce you're six months in, all that hard work should finally start to show. If your workouts focus on strength training, you'll notice your muscles begin to take shape. You're also less likely to fall off the workout wagon at this point. Exercise programs often see a 50% dropout rate within the first six months, but after that more people stick with it.\\\\n\\\\nNow, if you're more focused on cardio, then by nine months of regular exercise you should see about a 25% increase in your VO2 max. VO2 max is often used as a measure of fitness and refers to the rate your body can transport oxygen to your muscles for fuel. Basically, higher VO2 max means you can run faster for longer. So a 25% increase in VO2 max, for example, means you can run about 20% farther in the same amount of time.\\\\n\\\\nAfter one year of regular exercise, your bones will be denser, which reduces your risk of osteoporosis. In fact, researchers have found that regular resistance training, when combined with aerobic exercise, can actually reverse the effects of osteoporosis after 12 months.\\\\n\\\\nNow, if you maintain your exercise program long term, your body might not be the only thing to benefit. Your bank account may also beef up a bit. One study revealed that older people who exercised five days a week for at least 30 minutes saved, on average, $2,500 a year in medical costs for heart-related health problems alone. You'll also be at a lower risk of developing arthritis, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain types of cancer like breast and colon.\\\\n\\\\nIn all probability, you're going to live longer than you otherwise would. And that longer life, it will likely feel more fulfilling, because exercise lowers the risk of anxiety and depression by reducing levels of stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline.\\\\n\\\\nOf course all these benefits depend on the type and intensity of your workout and how long you exercise for each week. A balanced diet is also paramount to a healthy lifestyle. For the average adult ages 18 to 64, the US Department of Health and Human Services recommends either a minimum of 2 1/2 hours per week of moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking or biking. Or at least 1 hour and 15 minutes each week that combines moderate and high-intensity workouts, like running or swimming sprints.\\\\n\\\\nOn top of that, make sure and take two days each week to strengthen your muscles with some weights or resistance training. This will help your overall speed and endurance. As you begin, it's important to pace yourself and not push too hard too fast, or you risk serious injury.\\\\n\\\\nYou'll discover that the fitter you become, the easier it will be to exert a little more energy the next week, the week after, and so forth.\\\\n\\\\nExercise smart and often, and you'll be running marathons in no time.\\\\n\\\\nRead more: http://www.businessinsider.com/sai\\\\n\\\\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/techinsider\\\\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/techinsider\\\\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tech_insider/\"\n",

This is a simple nichrome wire bending machine that you can make on the super-cheap. Of course we had to ramp things up by using a microcontroller to switch it on an off, but you can just use a high current power supply or variable transformer. Please double check the current rating vs. temperature of the manufacturers data sheet to make sure you're getting to the temperature needed. I stuck between 600 and 700 degree straight-wire temperatures. Google is your friend here! This video is just to get you started.

His violins are played by some of the top musicians in the world and sell for as much as $16 million. For centuries people have puzzled over what makes his violins so great and they are the most scientifically studied instruments in history. I spoke to two world class violinists who play Stradivarius violins as well as a violin-maker about what makes Stradivari so great.
